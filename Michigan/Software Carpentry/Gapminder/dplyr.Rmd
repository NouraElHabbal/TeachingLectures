```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Lets say we want to calculate the average GDP/capita for each continent. lets use subsetting, first lets make sure we have gapminder loaded

# Subsetting and calculating means (2:30-2:35)

```{r means-africa}
library(gapminder)
#update this based on how Zena taught subsetting
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)
gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa",]
#alternate method
subset(gapminder, continent == 'Africa')
gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa",]$gdpPercap
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa",]$gdpPercap)
```

Now lets do it for the Americas

```{r means-other}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas",]$gdpPercap)
#now for asia
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia",]$gdpPercap)
```


Here there is lots of repeating yourself, so to do this more reproducibly we are going to use a package called dplyr


```{r dplyr-installation}
#install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
```

There are several commands including select, filter and group_by/summarize that we are going to go through today.

# Select (2:35-2:40)

```{r select}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)
gapminder
year_country_gdp
```

What did this do?  Select picks out a subset of columns.  See image at `https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/13-dplyr-fig1.png`

# Filter (2:40-2:45)

Filters can select a subset of rows.

```{r filter}
gapminder_euro <- filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe")
#similar to subset
gapminder_euro <- subset(gapminder, continent=="Europe")

#written another way with pipes
gapminder_euro <- gapminder %>% filter(continent=="Europe")
```

## Pipes

These allow you to chain several functions together

```{r pipes}
year_country_gdp_euro <- 
  gapminder %>%
  filter(continent=="Europe") %>%
  select(year,country,gdpPercap)
```

# Challenge 1 (2:45-2:50)

```{challenge-1}
Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a dataframe that has the African values for lifeExp, country and year, but not for other Continents. How many rows does your dataframe have and why?
```

# Group By with Summarize (2:50-3:00)

Now lets look at the combination of group_by and summarize

```{r group_by-1}
gapminder
gapminder %>% group_by(continent)
```

Lets look at the structure using the `str` command

```{r group_by-2}
str(gapminder)
str(gapminder %>% group_by(continent))
```

This is kinda boring but the power is that now things are grouped you can calculate things.  Show the image at `https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/13-dplyr-fig3.png`

![Image for group_by](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/13-dplyr-fig3.png)

```{r group_by-3}
gdp_bycontinents <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
gdp_bycontinents
```

Now lets sort these high to low

```{r group_by-4}
gdp_bycontinents <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_gdpPercap))
gdp_bycontinents
```

Now lets do a couple of different calculations

```{r group_by-5}
gdp_bycontinents <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
            max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap),
            min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap))
gdp_bycontinents
```

# Group By and Summarize Challenge (3:00-3:05)

```{challenge}
Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?
```

# Multiple variables (3:05-3:10)

```{r multiple-variables}
#lets group by multiple variables, here lets now incude year and contienent
gdp_bycontinents_years <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_gdpPercap))
gdp_bycontinents_years
```

# Mutate (3:10-3:20)

Mutate adds a new column

```{r mutate}
gdp_bycontinents <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
            max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap),
            min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap)) 
gdp_bycontinents

gdp_bycontinents <- 
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
            max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap),
            min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap)) %>%
  mutate(diff_gdpPercap=max_gdpPercap-min_gdpPercap)
gdp_bycontinents
```

# Piping to GGPlot (3:20-3:30)

```{r ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year,continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
	# Make the plot
	ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_life_exp)) +
	geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

# Final Challenge (3:30-3:45)

```{final-challenge}
Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in reverse order. Hint: Use the dplyr functions arrange() and sample_n(), they have similar syntax to other dplyr functions.
```
