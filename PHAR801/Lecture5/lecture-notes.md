# Lecture Outline

This lecture will cover the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal and pathophyiological states, especially diabetes.  It will focus on pharmacological interventions for both of these pathologies.  This lecture will cover the following four topics.

* Physiological regulation of blood glucose
* Insulin Signaling
* Glucagon Signaling
* Pathophysiology related to glucose control
    * Type I Diabetes
    * Type II Diabetes

# Diabetes in the United States.

![County Level Prevalence in Type II Diabetes](figures/diabetes_2010_map.png)

As of 2011, diabetes affects 25.8 million people or 8.3% of the population.  This includes approximately 7 million undiagnosed individuals.  In addition to this, 79 million Americans over the age of 20 are estimated to be pre-diabetic.  As of 2007, diabetes is estimated to cost $116 billion in direct and $58 billion in indirect costs [@CDC2011].

Diabetes is especially prevalent in this region.  As shown in the map, there is a higher percentage of diabetics in the mid and deep south regions of the United States.

# Acute regulation of circulating glucose

Glucose is maintained in a very narrow range

## Primary control mechanisms
* postprandially regulated by insulin
* under starvation regulated by glucagon

# Consequences of dysfunctional glucose homeostasis

## Hyperglycemia
* Chronic hyperglycemia leads to glycation of membrane proteins.  This leads to damaged nerves, kidneys, eyes, circulatory system (amputation) and Alzheimer's disease.
* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

## Hypoglycemia
* Feinting, dizziness
* Diabetic ketoacidosis


# Mechanisms of glucose control
* Glucose production
* Removal of glucose from the blood
* Synthesis of triglycerides and glycogen

# Insulin Signaling
* Physiological effects of insulin 
* Secretion of insulin
* Insulin signal transduction

# Glucagon Signaling
* Physiological effects of glucagaon
* Regulation of glucagon release
* Effects of glucagon on the liver

# Pathophysiology related to glucose control

# Type I Diabetes Mellitus
* Loss of insulin producing cells
* Treatment options

# Insulin Resistance and Type II Diabetes Mellitus

# Mechanisms Underlying Insulin Resistance
* Inflammatory mediators of insulin resistance
* Mediation of insulin resistance by mTORC1

# Adaptations to Insulin Resistance
* Hyperinsulinemia
* Pancreatic Failure

# Other Control Circuits Related to Glucose Control
* Regulation of food intake
* Hypothalamic regulation of glucose release
* Counterinflammatory responses

# Common Pharmacological Interventions for Insulin Resistance
* Primary intervention is diet and exercise alteration

## Insulin sensitizers
* Thiazolidinediones
* Mechanism of action

## Insulin secretagogues: 
* Sulfonylureas

## Glucose Utilization
* Metformin
* Mechanism of action

# Potential Future Interventions for Insulin Resistance

## Generation of Beige Fat
## Anti-inflammatory Interventions
