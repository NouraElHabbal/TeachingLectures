#Diabetes

## Diabetes in the United States.

![County Level Prevalence in Type II Diabetes](figures/diabetes_2010_map.png)

As of 2011, diabetes affects 25.8 million people or 8.3% of the population.  This includes approximately 7 million undiagnosed individuals.  In addition to this, 79 million Americans over the age of 20 are estimated to be pre-diabetic.  As of 2007, diabetes is estimated to cost $116 billion in direct and $58 billion in indirect costs [@CDC2011].

Diabetes is especially prevalent in this region.  As shown in the map, there is a higher percentage of diabetics in the mid and deep south regions of the United States.

##Complications of Diabetes

The major complications of diabetes include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and stroke.  These events are primarily due to excessive glycation of extracellular and intracellular targets preventing their function.

## The Discovery of Insulin

Insulin was discovered by Frederick Banting and his colleagues at the University of Toronto in 1921.  They performed experiments in which they injected extracts from pancreas fractions into dogs which had their pancreas' surgically removed.  They showed that a secreted substance from the pancreas lowered blood glucose in these dogs [@Banting1922].  They were then able to confirm that this treatment was also effective in children with diabetes [@Banting1922a].  This work led to Banting and John Macleod winning the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1923.

# Normal regulation of circulating glucose

Glucose is maintained in a very narrow range, between 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L.  These levels need to be re-established after changes in feeding status, or energy utilization.  In general, when glucose levels decrease, glucagon is released from alpha cells of the pancreas to promote glucose production, either from glycogen breakdown or gluconeogenesis.  Alternately, after a meal when glucose levels increase, insulin is secreted from beta cells of the pancreas causing glucose levels to decrease.

## Mechanisms of glucose control

For the purposes of the acute maintenance of glucose homeostasis, four organs are the most important; the pancreas, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.  The pancreas senses changes in glucose levels and responds by releasing either glucagon or insulin. 

### Glucose Uptake

Glucose is taken up down a concentration gradient into most tissues including liver, pancreas, kidneys and the brain.  However, for glucose to enter into muscle and fat tissue, insulin is required.  

### Glycolysis

The major route for energy production is glycolysis, the TCA cycle and oxidative respiration in the mitochondria.  This pathway converts glucose and other carbohydrates first into pyruvate, then into components used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP in the mitochondria.  

Glycolysis is regulated both by allosteric activators and inhibitors, as well as by protein phosphorylation in response to extracellular and intracellular signals.


### Gluconeogenesis

Gluconeogenesis is the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursor molecules.  These typically include amino acids, lactate and the products of fatty acid oxidation.  The vast majority of gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver.  This process is similar to reverse glycolysis though in several cases different enzymes are used.  

The rate limiting enzymes in gluconeogenesis are Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and Glucose-6-Phosphatase.  These enzymes are under both transcriptional and post-translational control as described below.

### Glycogenesis 

As an alternative to glycolysis, glucose can also be stored in esterified form as glycogen.  To form glycogen, glucose must first be converted through Glucose-1-Phosphate into UDP-Glucose.  This activated form of glucose is then added onto existing glycogen chains through the activity of an enzyme named Glycogen Synthase.  In addition to being regulated by protein phosphorylation and sub-cellular location, Glycogen synthase is also allosterically activated by Glucose-6-Phosphate, promoting increased glycogen synthesis when glucose levels in the cell are high.

### Glycogenolysis

To liberate glucose from stored glycogen, glycogen phosphorylase is activated.  This enzyme hydrolyses glycogen releasing glucose-1-phosphate, which can then be dephophorylated into glucose for glycolysis or release into the blood stream.  In addition to post-translational modifications and recruitment to the glycogen pellet by accessory proteins, glycogen phosphorylase is allosterically activated by energy stress such as increases in AMP, or negatively by increases in Glucose-6-Phosphate levels.

## Endocrine Control of Blood Glucose

In order to balance the energy requirements of all tissues, blood glucose is primarily controlled via endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms.  The primary mediators are insulin and glucagon which are secreted from the pancreas during times of hyper and hypoglycemia respectively.

## Insulin Functions

When glucose levels are raised, such as after a meal, insulin has four main functions, all of which serve to reduce blood glucose levels:

1. Promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and adipose tissue.  
2. Enhances the synthesis of glycogen and triglycerides in liver, adipose and muscle.  
3. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis, or the production of glucose from non-glucose precursors such as amino acids and lipids.
4. Promote the breakdown of glucose via glycolysis.

### Insulin Secretion

![Regulation of insulin secretion by beta cells in pancreatic islets. [@Dean2004].](figures/insulin-secretion.png)

Beta cells in the pancreas generate insulin and store it in pre-formed secretory granules.  After glucose mediated depolarization of beta cells in response to insulin, these secretory granules are exocytosed and their contentes are released into the blood.

## Insulin Signal Transduction

Insulin functions by binding to and activating a receptor tyrosine kinase.  This receptor transautophosphorylates itself generating binding sites for phosphotyrosine binding proteins known as insulin receptor substrates.

These proteins are also phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, which creates binding sites for a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).  This kinases generates the key second messenger in insulin signaling, phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3).  Most known functions of insulin are blocked when PI3K is inhibited [@Kanai1993].

Once PIP3 is generated by insulin stimulation, it can diffuse along the internal membranes of the cells.  This lipid second messenger recruits two important protein kinases, Akt (also referred to as PKB) and PDK1.  Both of these proteins have domains called pleckstrin homology domains which recruit the kinases together to the plasma membrane.  Once there, PDK1 and another protein kinase called mTORC2 are able to phosphorylate and activate Akt.  Once activated, Akt is the most important protein kinase in mediating insulin function.

### Insulin Stimulated Glucose Uptake

In fat and muscle tissue, insulin promotes the movement of a facilitative glucose transporter named GLUT4.  Normally GLUT4 resides in intracellular compartments, but in response to insulin vesicles form these compartments fuse with the plasma membrane, inserting GLUT4 into the extracellular surface.  This allows for glucose to enter fat and muscle cells [@Leto2012].

In both fat and muscle, the PI3K/Akt dependent signaling pathways are absolutely required for insulin stimulated glucose uptake [@Okada1994].  The major targets of Akt in this signaling pathway are AS160 and RGC1/2, two proteins which regulate the activity of small GTPases involved in GLUT4 translocation [@Leto2012].  These mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

### How Does Insulin Stimulate Glycogenesis

Allosterically, the other functions of insulin, including promoting glucose uptake and glycolysis will provide more UDP-Glucose for glycogen synthase, and will also allosterically activate the enzyme by generating large amounts of Glucose-6-Phosphate.  

In addition to these allosteric activators, both glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase are regulated by protein phosphorylation.  In the case of glycogen synthase, the phosphorylated form is relatively inactive, and is resistant to allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate [@Friedman1963].  Glycogen synthase is phosphorylated by several protein kinases including AMPK and GSK-3 [@Parker1982].  In addition to inactivating the upstream kinases, insulin also activates a protein phosphatase, which removes the phosphate groups.  

![Regulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin and protein phosphorylation.](figures/glycogen-synthesis-insulin.png)


In a co-ordinated way, protein phosphorylation activates glycogen phosphorylase [@Krebs1964].  This means that when these enzymes are phosphorylated, the balance tips towards glycogenolysis, and when they are dephosphorylated glycogen is synthesized.

<!--- ### What are the Mechanisms of Insulin Stimulated Lipogenesis --->

<!--- ### How Does Insulin Suppress Lipolysis and Lipid Oxidation --->

### How Does Insulin Suppress Gluconeogenesis

The activation of glucose uptake and glycolysis leads to increased levels of several glycolytic intermediates which themselves will regulate gluconeogenesis.  The most important of these is Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate which is raised during glycolysis and inhibits FBPase, one of the key rate limiting steps in gluconeogenesis.

In addition to these effects, both G6Pase and PEPCK, two other rate limiting enzymes are regulated transcriptionally.  Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factor FOXO which would normally drive the expression of these enzymes.  Therefore when insulin activate the PI3K/Akt cascade, FOXO mediated transcription of G6Pase and PEPCK is decreased and the levels of these enzymes are reduced, decreasing gluconeogenesis.

## Exercise and Sympathetic Tone

### Adrenaline and the Sympathetic Nervous System

Since glucagon works primarily on liver tissue, different hormonal messengers function to stimulate catabolism in muscle and fat tissue.  The activation of PKA by GPCR and cAMP signaling pathways leads to glycogen breakdown in muscle via similar mechanisms as those in liver.  Adrenaline also leads to enhanced lipid and glucose oxidation in muscle primarily as an energy source.

In adipose tissue, these pathways induce lipolysis, via phosphorylation and activation of Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL), Perilipin and Adipocyte Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL).  These proteins function to mobilize triglycerides into free fatty acids for use in other tissues, especially muscle.  For more information on the regulation of lipolysis, see [@Young2013].  At an acute level, these do not contribute much to glucose homeostasis.

### The AMPK Activated Protein Kinase

Intracellularly, when levels of ATP decrease and correspondingly, the levels of AMP rise, a protein kinase called the AMP Activated Protein Kinase is turned on.  AMPK is like a cellular fuel gauge, so that when ATP levels are decreased, energy producing pathways are activated and energy using pathways are reduced [@Hardie2012].

# Pathophysiology related to glucose control

## Consequences of dysfunctional glucose homeostasis

### Hypoglycemia
* Feinting, dizziness
* Diabetic ketoacidosis

### Hyperglycemia
* Chronic hyperglycemia leads to glycation of membrane proteins.  This leads to damaged nerves, kidneys, eyes, circulatory system (amputation) and Alzheimer's disease.
* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

## Type I Diabetes Mellitus

### Loss of Insulin Producing Cells


## Insulin Resistance and Type II Diabetes Mellitus

### Obesity and Insulin Sensitivity

### Why Insulin Resistance

### Molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance

Obese individuals respond poorly to insulin, including less insulin stimulated glucose uptake, and less insulin suppression of glucose production in the liver.  Biochemical measurements were done to dissect these processes.  These studies showed the activity of the PI3K signaling pathways were reduced in obese states [@Goodyear1995][@Saad1992].  This is thought to occur via serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins [@Takayama1984][@White1985].  This prevents these substrates from being phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and prevents the activation of the PI3K signal transduction cascade.

## Glucose Utilization

One class of drugs called biguanides is a common therapeutic for Type II Diabetes.  These drugs, such as phenformin and metformin (marketed as Glucophage) function by disrupting mitochondrial function.   These leads to energy stress and activation of AMPK due to the increases in intracellular AMP [@Zhou2001].  The activation of AMPK leads to activation of energy producing pathways, including glucose uptake and oxidation and lipid oxidation.
The effects of this are to reduce circulating glucose, while also burning fat.
