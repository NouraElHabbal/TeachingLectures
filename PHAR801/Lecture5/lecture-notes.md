# Lecture Outline

This lecture will cover the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal and pathophyiological states, especially diabetes.  It will focus on pharmacological interventions for both of these pathologies.  This lecture will cover the following four topics.

* Physiological regulation of blood glucose
* Insulin Signaling
* Glucagon Signaling
* Pathophysiology related to glucose control
    * Type I Diabetes
    * Type II Diabetes
* Common Pharmacological Interventions for Insulin Resistance

# Diabetes in the United States.

![County Level Prevalence in Type II Diabetes](figures/diabetes_2010_map.png)

As of 2011, diabetes affects 25.8 million people or 8.3% of the population.  This includes approximately 7 million undiagnosed individuals.  In addition to this, 79 million Americans over the age of 20 are estimated to be pre-diabetic.  As of 2007, diabetes is estimated to cost $116 billion in direct and $58 billion in indirect costs [@CDC2011].

Diabetes is especially prevalent in this region.  As shown in the map, there is a higher percentage of diabetics in the mid and deep south regions of the United States.

# Acute regulation of circulating glucose

Glucose is maintained in a very narrow range, between 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L.  These levels need to be re-established after changes in feeding status, or energy utilization.  In general, when glucose levels decrease, glucagon is released from alpha cells of the pancreas to promote glucose production, either from glycogen breakdown or gluconeogenesis.  Alternately, after a meal when glucose levels increase, insulin is secreted from beta cells of the pancreas causing glucose levels to decrease.

## Mechanisms of glucose control

For the purposes of the acute maintenance of glucose homeostasis, four organs are the most important; the pancreas, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.  The pancreas senses changes in glucose levels and responds by releasing either glucagon or insulin.  

## Insulin Signaling

Insulin was discovered by Frederick Banting and his colleagues at the University of Toronto in 1921.  They performed experiments in which they injected extracts from pancreas fractions into dogs which had their pancreas' surgically removed.  They showed that a secreted substance from the pancreas lowered blood glucose in these dogs [@Banting1922].  They were then able to confirm that this treatment was also effective in children with diabetes [@Banting1922a].  This work led to Banting and John Macleod winning the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1923.



### Insulin Secretion

### Physiological effects of insulin 
When glucose levels are raised, such as after a meal, insulin has four main functions:

1. Promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and adipose tissue.  
2. Enhances the synthesis of glycogen in liver, adipose and muscle.  
3. Accelerates the synthesis of triglycerides in fat, and to a lesser extent muscle and liver.  
4. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis, or the production of glucose from non-glucose precursors such as amino acids and lipids.

### Insulin signal transduction

## Glucagon Signaling

### Physiological effects of glucagaon
 When glucose levels are low, glucagon promotes the breakdown of glycogen stores in liver and muscle, and the generation of glucose from gluconeogenic precursors primarily in the liver.  
 
### Regulation of glucagon release
### Effects of glucagon on the liver

## Consequences of dysfunctional glucose homeostasis

### Hypoglycemia
* Feinting, dizziness
* Diabetic ketoacidosis

### Hyperglycemia
* Chronic hyperglycemia leads to glycation of membrane proteins.  This leads to damaged nerves, kidneys, eyes, circulatory system (amputation) and Alzheimer's disease.
* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

# Pathophysiology related to glucose control

## Type I Diabetes Mellitus

### Loss of Insulin Producing Cells
### Insulin Administration
The amino acid sequence of insulin was determined by Frederick Sanger, which led to him winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 [@Sanger1951].  This eventually allowed for recombinant production and manipulation of insulin, rather than using purified porcine, ovine or bovine insulin.
