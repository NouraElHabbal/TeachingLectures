# Lecture Outline

* Physiological regulation of blood glucose
* Insulin Signaling
* Glucagon Signaling
* Pathophysiology related to glucose control

# Acute regulation of circulating glucose

* maintained in narrow range

## Primary control mechanisms
* postprandially regulated by insulin
* under starvation regulated by glucagon

## Consequences of dysfunctional glucose homeostasis
* hyperglycemia
* hypoglycemia

# Mechanisms of glucose control
* Glucose production
* Removal of glucose from the blood
* Synthesis of triglycerides and glycogen

# Insulin Signaling
* Physiological effects of insulin 
* Secretion of insulin
* Insulin signal transduction

# Glucagon Signaling
* Physiological effects of glucagaon
* Regulation of glucagon release
* Effects of glucagon on the liver

# Pathophysiology related to glucose control

# Type I Diabetes Mellitus
* Loss of insulin producing cells
* Treatment options

# Insulin Resistance and Type II Diabetes Mellitus

# Mechanisms Underlying Insulin Resistance
* Inflammatory mediators of insulin resistance
