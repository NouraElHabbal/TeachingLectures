# Lectures and Learning Objectives

Below are the learning objectives for each of the lectures.

## Endocrine control systems

* Define endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and exocrine systems, define neuro-secretory cells by giving a few examples.
* List major categories of hormones and give several examples that belong to each class.
* List important factors that determine hormone levels in circulation.
* Explain cellular actions of hormones via membrane and nuclear receptors, including an understanding of the rates by which these processes can affect cells.
* Define basal secretion and stimulated secretion of endocrine glands.
* Describe negative and positive feedback system using an example.
* Explain with examples neuroendocrine integration.

## Neuroendocrinology and the posterior pituitary gland

* Recall anatomical, biochemical, and functional evidence showing intimate relationships between hypothalamus and neurohypophysis.
* Describe how hormones are sensed by the neurons of the hypothalamus, and the role that the blood brain barrier and transport mechanisms play.
* Recall how the central nervous system can integrate with the hypothalamus and modify both hormonal secretions and executive function.
* Describe the differences in how hypothalamic signals are passed to the posterior and anterior pituitary glands.
* List the known hypothalamic hormones which cause release (and release-inhibition) of anterior pituitary hormones, including their acronymns. 
* Name two major posterior pituitary hormones in man, name their chemical category, and succinctly describe their secretory mechanism.
* Describe cellular actions of vasopressin in terms of site of actions, receptors, and cellular signals.
* Discuss briefly aquaporin water channels and relation to vasopressin. 
* Predict what the changes are expected in urine volume and osmolality and in ECF volume when vasopressin synthesis or secretion is severely impaired. Predict what will happen to water intake. Explain why there can be transient diabetes insipidus following a whiplash injury, and the rationale for therapy during this time. 
* Describe the control of vasopressin release.
* Describe the function of oxytocin with respect to delivery and lactation.
