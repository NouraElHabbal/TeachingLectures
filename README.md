TeachingLectures
================

These are the lecture slides and lecture notes for courses that I have taught.
Each course is in a directory, then each lecture is in a subdirectory of that folder.

Format
--------
The lectures are written in markdown format  (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>) and then parsed into slides and handouts using pandoc.
